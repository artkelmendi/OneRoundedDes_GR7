# Structure of ONE-ROUND DES
The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key block cipher that encrypts data in 64-bit blocks using a 56-bit key. 
One round of DES is a single iteration of its core encryption process, and DES consists of 16 such rounds. Each round enhances the security of the encryption.
