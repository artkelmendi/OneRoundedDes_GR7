# DES Round Simulator

## Overview
The DES Round Simulator is a JavaFX-based application designed to simulate a single round of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm. It provides a graphical user interface for users to input the left half, right half, and subkey, and then compute the results of the DES round function.

## Features
- **Graphical User Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for input and output of DES round values.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the inputs for the left half, right half, and subkey meet the required bit lengths.
- **DES Round Computation**: Simulates the expansion, substitution, and permutation steps of a DES round.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following main components:
- `app`: Contains the main application entry point and the navigator for switching between scenes.
- `Controllers`: Contains the controllers for handling user interactions and logic for the DES round and welcome page.

## Installation
To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd des-round-simulator
    ```
